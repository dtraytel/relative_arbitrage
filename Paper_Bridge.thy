  Title:   Paper_Bridge.thy
  Content: The bridge from the repo's market witnesses to the paper's
           class (1.7) of arXiv:2512.17702.

           Per the paper's (1.7)-(1.8) the processes in P_x are NEVER
           stopped: the covariation constraint holds for a.e. t >= 0 and
           tau_K is merely a functional of the path.  A `stopped_market'
           witness is therefore NOT a class member -- its volatility
           vanishes after its stopping time, and 0 is not admissible.
           The faithful bridge CONTINUES the witness past the stopping
           time with an admissible volatility; `Paper_Class.acont' does
           that, and `Paper_Class.mat_1_in_sconstraint' supplies the
           value (legitimate exactly because the locale carries the
           paper's standing assumption L >= 1).

           This theory sits downstream of BOTH Paper_Class and the
           market stack, so that neither has to import the other.

  STATUS:  PIDE-verified (359 commands, overall_status ok).  Since
           2026-08-05 the volatility side of the bridge is HYPOTHESIS-FREE:
           the time-measurability of `acov' that the two integrability
           results used to assume is now a locale assumption
           (`acov_time_measurable', on {0..}), transported to the
           continuation by `Paper_Class.acont_set_borel_measurable'.

           HISTORY: registering this NEW theory in ROOT wedged the
           running PIDE session -- the server snapshots ROOT at startup,
           so afterwards every theory reported "Malformed theory", and
           reverting the ROOT edit did NOT recover it.  A restart was
           required.  To add a theory mid-session, prefer adding an
           import to an existing theory instead.

section \<open>Extracting the pointwise constraint from a market witness\<close>

text \<open>The locale's volatility hypotheses are stated as three separate
  almost-sure facts, each valid only up to the stopping time.  Combined
  and continued they give a single almost-sure statement holding for ALL
  times, which is the shape \<open>paper_pair_class\<close> asks for.\<close>

text \<open>In particular the continued volatility of a market witness never
  leaves the constraint set, whereas the witness's own volatility does the
  moment it is stopped -- which is precisely the mismatch this theory
  exists to repair.\<close>

section \<open>Integrability of the continued volatility\<close>

text \<open>To build the running covariation \<open>Yint\<close> from a witness the continued
  volatility must be INTEGRABLE on bounded intervals.  Boundedness is free:
  on \<open>[0, tau \<omega>]\<close> the locale's \<open>psd\<close> + \<open>eigen_ub L\<close> bound every entry by \<open>L\<close>
  (via \<open>sconstraint_norm_le\<close>), and after \<open>tau \<omega>\<close> the continuation is the
  constant \<open>mat 1\<close>.  What the locale does NOT supply is MEASURABILITY of
  \<open>acov\<close> in the TIME variable: \<open>acov_trace_integrable\<close> covers only the
  trace, and \<open>coord_Z\<close> only the diagonal entries.

  That gap is now CLOSED IN THE LOCALE: \<open>sufficiently_volatile_market\<close>
  carries \<open>acov_time_measurable\<close>, stated on the nonnegative axis, which is
  faithful rather than a strengthening --- the paper's (1.7) constrains
  \<open>d\<langle>X\<^sub>i,X\<^sub>j\<rangle>(t)/dt\<close>, and that presupposes the covariation density exists
  as a measurable object in \<open>t\<close>.  So the theorem below no longer carries a
  measurability hypothesis; \<open>Paper_Class.acont_set_borel_measurable\<close>
  transports the locale's fact to the continuation, and
  \<open>set_borel_measurable_subset\<close> cuts it down to the interval at hand
  (legitimately, since \<open>0 \<le> s\<close> puts \<open>{s..t}\<close> inside \<open>{0..}\<close>).\<close>

section \<open>The witness satisfies the class's covariation condition\<close>

section \<open>NC-3: the martingale clauses of Lemma 2.3\<close>

text \<open>This section needs BOTH sides of the development --- the paper class
  from \<open>Paper_Class\<close> and the Section-2 law machinery from \<open>Section_2_Usc\<close>
  (\<open>martingale_bounded_test\<close>, \<open>metric_measure_eqI_bounded_cts\<close>) --- which is
  why it lives here rather than in \<open>Paper_Class\<close>.

  The two clauses of (1.7) that are CLOSED conditions on a single path
  already pass to a weak limit (\<open>Paper_Class.paper_pair_class_start_limit\<close>,
  \<open>\<dots>_diffquot_limit\<close>).  The martingale clauses are not of that kind: they
  are statements about integrals against past-measurable test functions, and
  only BOUNDED CONTINUOUS tests survive a weak limit.  So the route is
  (i) state the identity at a class member against a bounded continuous
  test, (ii) pass it through the weak limit using the uniform \<open>L\<^sup>2\<close> bound,
  (iii) upgrade from continuous tests to past events, (iv) reassemble a
  martingale through the set-integral characterisation.

  Step (i) needs the test function to be measurable for the NATURAL
  FILTRATION of the coordinate process, while it is naturally a function of
  the RESTRICTED path.  The two agree, and the non-trivial inclusion ---
  \<open>\<sigma>(restriction) \<subseteq> \<F>\<^sub>s\<close> --- is exactly what
  \<open>Path_Space.pathify_measurable\<close> proves: the restriction map is the
  "path map" of the coordinate process on \<open>{0..s}\<close>, and that theorem reduces
  a ball of the path metric to countably many evaluation conditions.\<close>

subsection \<open>From continuous tests to past events\<close>

text \<open>The monotone-class step, in the form the paper's class needs.  Split
  the increment into positive and negative parts, push each forward through
  the restriction map as a DENSITY, and observe that the limit identity says
  exactly that the two image measures integrate every bounded continuous
  function alike.  \<open>Section_2_Usc.metric_measure_eqI_bounded_cts\<close> then makes
  the two measures EQUAL, so they agree on every past event.

  One wrinkle: that engine supplies tests bounded only on the TOPSPACE,
  whereas \<open>paper_pair_class_martingale_test_limit\<close> asks for a global bound.
  Composing with \<open>rclamp\<close> repairs it --- the clamp is invisible where the
  bound already holds, hence on the whole space of the measures involved.\<close>

subsection \<open>Lemma 2.3: three of the four clauses, at the limit\<close>

text \<open>Where the closedness half of Lemma 2.3 stands.  A weak limit of

  \<open>X\<close>-MARTINGALE clause of (1.7); what is missing for
  \<open>Q \<in> paper_pair_class k L T x\<close> is exactly the compensated clause
  \<open>outerp X - Y\<close>, and only because carrying IT through the weak limit needs
  an \<open>L\<^sup>2\<close> bound on \<open>X\<^sub>i X\<^sub>j\<close>, i.e. a uniform FOURTH moment.  That is the
  same bound NC-2's tightness needs, and it is the one thing this route
  does not yet supply --- the paper gets it from Burkholder--Davis--Gundy,
  which the AFP does not have.  Stating the partial conclusion explicitly
  keeps the gap honest and machine-checked.\<close>
